/// node was made so that js can be executed outside of the browser 
// they took the v8 engine and then added few functionalities 
// node js is runtime that can run js in the backend also 

// bun is faster runtime of js because node was slower in the backend 



/// things you can do with node js -- createa clis , create http servers , create video games , create a game

// /// creating a HTTP server is what mainly done 

// what is an http server???? -- protocol for machines to communicating , most common way for frontend to talk to its backend

// how do they talk -??? -- routers and wires 
// http servers -- accepts string from user who is authenticated then sends a response ,,, server follows http protocol and then able to communicate with client 


/// http protocol --- client throwing something to server - server doing some processing - server sending back a response 
// client uses a url - server does something with request - server send back some data
// argument of func - func doing some code processing - func returning something 



///// http protocol ----- things client / server needs to worry about 

//    http client side --- protocol(http/https) , address(url/ip/port) , route , header/body(payload)/parameters , method 

//    http server side ---- response header , response body , status codes 

//   common methods - get post put delete
//   http status codes - 200 ok , 404 page not found , 403 auth issue , 500 internal server error
//  why do we need status codes ? --
